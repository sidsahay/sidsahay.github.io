				He woke up with a start, feeling woozy and disoriented. The edges of reality seemed blurred and warped,
				as if an inconsiderate window-washer had elected to wash the invisible mental window through which one
				perceives one’s surroundings. It had been a long nap, hadn’t it? His mother would not be happy. Homework

The eerie firelight illuminates their bodies with ghostly flickers, making them strain their eyes to catch a sign, any sign, of the deadly and unknown enemy lying hidden among the trees. In their world, it’s kill or be killed, and the enemy has a massive upper hand in technology, numbers, and tactics. The squad has very little chance of making it back unscathed. They will be worse off by the end of this mission, whether they succeed or not. <a class="button" href="writings/nonfiction/wilxcomew.html">read more</a>
