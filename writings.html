				He woke up with a start, feeling woozy and disoriented. The edges of reality seemed blurred and
				warped, as if an inconsiderate window-washer had elected to wash the invisible mental window through
				which one perceives one’s surroundings. It had been a long nap, hadn’t it? His mother would not be

				bodies with ghostly flickers, making them strain their eyes to catch a sign, any sign, of the deadly
				and unknown enemy lying hidden among the trees. In their world, it’s kill or be killed, and the
