				He woke up with a start, feeling woozy and disoriented. The edges of reality seemed blurred and warped,
				as if an inconsiderate window-washer had elected to wash the invisible mental window through which one

The eerie firelight illuminates their bodies with ghostly flickers, making them strain their eyes to catch a sign, any sign, of the deadly and unknown enemy lying hidden among the trees.
