                He woke up with a start, feeling woozy and disoriented. The edges of reality seemed blurred and warped, as if an
                inconsiderate window-washer had elected to wash the invisible mental window through which one perceives one’s
                surroundings. It had been a long nap, hadn’t it? His mother would not be happy. Homework was always supposed to
                be done on time. Oh well.

                Still encased in the sleep-pod, the boy yawned and stretched, dearly wishing that the day would get over already
                so that he could get back to sleep. The pod was so comfortable, surely his parents wouldn’t mind if he just
                rested his head on the pillow for a litt-<br>
                “Ah, I’m glad to see you’re awake, sir! How may I serve? What would you like for breakfast? Should I run you a
                bath?”

                The boy winced. The Triga-…Trige-….Triga-something (he could never remember the thing’s actual name),
                affectionately known as Tri, was a helper AI that his parents had installed to watch over him, represented on
                the material plane by a faintly glowing circle hanging in the air that changed colour based on moods. It wasn’t
                all that bad, oh no. Tri was playful, and helpful, and so good at telling stories. If only it wouldn’t be so
                happy all the time. It could get fairly jarring, especially if one’s brain is still mired in the process of
                trudging its way towards full consciousness. Still, Tri was a constant. Tri would always be there, just a call
                away. And, as his stomach chose that moment to announce its needs with a large rumble, he realized he was pretty
                hungry.

                “Morning, Tri. Can I have what Mom made the other day? I’m starving.”<br>
                “Certainly, sir. I will prepare it. But first you must brush your teeth! Madam’s orders.” The circle vanished
                with a self-important flash of purple.

                The boy groaned in irritation. When he became an adult he’d run for the Senate Presidency and abolish brushing
                as a requirement before meals. It was a truly diabolical custom. However, diabolical or not, he still had to do
                it.

            <p class="text normal">
                As he emerged from the bathroom he saw it happen for the first time. It was a curious thing. A patch of wall
                panelling in front of him, along with assorted objects in that area, suddenly became a featureless,
                dimensionless grey. It wasn’t a grey object, it was something more, yet lesser, as if he was looking at a
                surface that existed outside the usual three-dimensional world, a surface that should not, could not exist in
                the real world. The unreality of the surface held him spellbound with a strangely disturbed fascination. He
                wanted to touch it. Some part of him knew that it wasn’t a good idea, that touching strange-looking surfaces
                after brushing in the morning would not be conducive to good health, but another part of him was strangely
                attracted to it, felt a deep yearning to know what would happen…
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                The surface vanished.

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                He blinked, walked forwards cautiously. Normal matter all around. Solid objects. Three dimensional. He felt the
                wall where the surface had appeared. Nothing out of the ordinary. This was most disconcerting. He asked for
                expert help.

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                “Hey Tri, what was that?”<br>
                The circle promptly appeared in a puff of blue.<br>
                “To what object do you refer, sir?”<br>
                “That grey…thing. It was here, seconds ago!”<br>
                The circle paused, turned a sceptical yellow.<br>
                “There are no objects with that colour in your vicinity. Are you feeling all right, sir? Should I contact a
                physician?”
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                The boy was momentarily puzzled by this. How would a man who knew physics, of all things, help here? Then he
                remembered his mother telling him that physicians usually took more interest in the healing arts and matters
                medical.<br> Ah, a doctor. The thing wanted to call a doctor. He shook his head.

                “No, never mind. I must still be sleepy.”<br>
                “Very good, sir. Your breakfast is on the table. Sir and Madam have left for work already, and they left
                instructions that you are to be given a day off from your coursework today. Your tutors will come tomorrow
                instead.” The circle vanished again.

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                The boy immediately perked up. Saved! He now had an extra day to finish his homework. He then remembered the
                grey thing. A shiver ran through him. Perhaps it was just as well that he would not meet anybody else before his
                parents came back, he wanted to ask other people about the grey thing but was afraid of looking foolish. After
                all, if Tri couldn’t sense it, it didn’t exist. Did it?
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                His breakfast was waiting on the dining table. It was a mystery to him how Tri could affect things in the real
                world, since the only thing he had ever seen of the AI was the circle. Perhaps there were other mechanical
                servants who did all the actual work. It didn’t matter. Tri was highly efficient. Also, judging by the scent
                wafting from the dishes, a very good cook.
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                The boy attacked the food with gusto. His hunger surprised him, he didn’t think he could eat so much and yet
                feel hungry. He took another helping. And then another. And another. He noticed, yet again, just how good the
                food was. Nobody could cook that well, except for his mother. It was as if she had made it not ten minutes
                before. Maybe she had, she could have only just left for work, while he was waking up. Yes, that must be it.
                It was as he was reaching across the table for a glass of water that it happened for the second time. From the
                corner of his eye he noticed a sudden change. Filled with a sudden dread, he whirled to face it, and…yes, the
                greyness was back again. He recoiled from it, fell to the floor. It seemed to him that it had grown from before,
                it now seemed to blot out a much larger area of existence. No longer an object of fascination, it loomed over
                him, pale and menacing. It was terrifying in its complete featurelessness. His eyes could find no purchase on
                the surface to lock on to, nothing to pinpoint as the source of danger. He curled up into a ball and shut his
                eyes as tightly as he could, and called out for help.

                No response. No sounds either.

            <p class="text normal">
                He cautiously opened his eyes. No grey. The room was back to normal. Slowly, shakily, he got to his feet.
                Holding the chair for support, he called out again.
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                “Tri? Where are you?”

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                And this time, there was a response.
                A deep, stentorian voice filled his being. It sounded like Tri’s voice, but orders of magnitude more powerful,
                and infinitely sorrowful.
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">

            <p class="text normal">
                And suddenly the greyness was back again, except this time it was all around him, enveloping him, smothering
                him, and he was spiralling into it, screaming, falling down…<br>
                Down…<br>
                Down…<br>
                Down…

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                He woke up.

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                And immediately wished he hadn’t. And overwhelming feeling of disorientation assailed him, made it impossible to
                think. His head felt like it was being forcibly invaded by a pneumatic drill wielded by some ill-tempered lout.
                He couldn’t feel his arms or legs. A sudden tide of panic rose up within him, unquenchable. He tried to move his
                hands, but his body didn’t respond. He tried moving his legs, but that didn’t work either. He felt appallingly
                weak. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t focus. He was going to die here, die while he was strapped to a bed,
                unable to think, unable to move, unable to –
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                Wait. A bed. How did he know that he was strapped to a bed? He could feel the roughness of the bindings on his
                arms and around his torso. His arms! He could feel sensation returning slowly, a lazily creeping wave of
                awareness running through his upper body. He tried flexing a finger – yes, it worked. He realized he was holding
                his breath. Why was he holding his breath? He let it out, and drew in a deep lungful of air. The sudden release
                in tension was so abrupt that he almost cried. He still felt appallingly weak, and he still couldn’t feel his
                legs, but at least the upper body was a going proposition again.
            </p>
            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                It was only then that he noticed two things – his eyes were clenched shut, and that it was very cold. He wasn’t
                covered with a blanket or any other covering. He wanted a blanket. But the bindings were so tight! He could
                hardly even wriggle. The panic, which had been lounging about at the edges of his mind, waiting for just such an
                opportunity, struck again. His breathing speeded up, he was sweating despite the cold, he started thrashing
                against the bed –

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                The deep-voice-that-was-Tri-but-not-Tri. It wasn’t so stentorian any more, but seemed to be coming from in
                front. Hearing the echo of something familiar quelled his panic somewhat. And was that a flicker of sensation
                from his legs?

            <p class="text normal">
                He wasn’t imagining it. He could definitely feel his legs now. And with the increasing level of awareness came
                the discovery that the bed was not the only object in reach. There seemed to be masses of pipes and tubes
                everywhere his probing fingers touched, all slightly wet and very cold.

            <div class="hz-space"></div>
            <p class="text normal">
                He opened his eyes. He was surrounded by darkness except for one blinding white circle of light directly
                overhead, burning its image into his retinas. He winced and quickly shut his eyes again. The light really wasn’t
                helping his headache. He turned his head towards the left and opened his eyes again. Better. He could just dimly
                discern metallic shapes all around him. There seemed to be a large flat expanse behind it all, which seemed to
                burn with an unnatural reddish glow. Was there a fire outside?

                dimly recalled some of the things the voice had said before. Illusion? What had it meant by illusion? He tried
                to speak. It was difficult. His mouth was parched and his jaws seemed unable to move. With great difficulty he
                wrenched them open and spat the word out.

                Strange things? With a start he remembered. The greyness! A shiver went through his spine. The panic started

                oh wait, the voice had said that it was all in his mind. So it should not appear here. He found himself
                accepting what the voice had said. It was all because of the greyness. So muddled was he, and young, that he did
                not quite realize that it had been his own mind, fighting for control.

                “Before succumbing to the plague your father put you inside this stasis pod and charged me to look after you by
                creating a virtual reality for you to exist in, inside your mind, while your body was put in cryogenic
                suspension. He hoped that one day the quarantine would be lifted and you would be rescued. The plague is still
                in the air, dormant. No rescue ever came. You have been in stasis for twenty thousand years.”

                He felt himself reacting, the tears flowing freely. How long a time he spent in that state, he did not know. He
                eventually stopped, racked only by the occasional sob. What horror was this? What had he done to deserve this?
                The anger that suddenly welled up inside him surprised even him with its intensity.

                Twenty thousand years! The revelation suddenly flashed through his mind. The anger ebbed. Had he really lived
                for twenty thousand years? He probed his mind. He had no recollection of his life earlier on the station. And as
                he went farther back, he encountered a horrible feeling, as if his brain was trying to access something he had
                lost. He had lived for so long that his mind had started disintegrating, eating away the older memories and
                replacing them with newer ones. He wrenched himself away from it. The anger was back. He spoke.

                His voice was stronger now. The voice replied. He noticed that it flickered slightly, as if it was having
                trouble maintaining a constant volume. And was the bright circle also a little dimmer?

                “I am dying. My power cells are almost drained, the station’s fusion reactors depleted of fuel. The star’s
                output has decreased considerably over twenty thousand years, its energies are no longer enough to sustain me.
                It will die soon as well. Without power I cannot sustain you.”

                The words hammered through him. He was going to die, after all. His anger had been for nothing. He was going to
                freeze and choke over the course of several days as the support systems lost power, if starvation didn’t get him
                first. His body would be mummified by the cold, never to decay. He would forever circle the star in his icy
                tomb. The primal fear that was a hallmark of his species was back again.

                So this was it, then? Had he lived twenty thousand years for nothing? His father’s desperate plan to save him –

                His mind was still spinning in an endless loop, imagining his demise. He suddenly registered something the voice
                had said, something he had almost missed. He was still linked to the computer (for the voice was almost
                certainly a computer). He cautiously probed his mind, searching for anything that seemed out of the ordinary. To
                his surprise, he found it almost instantly, an alien nugget inside his mind. He drove his consciousness into it.

                There was a curious sensation of connection, and suddenly he could feel the station. He felt the whisper of the
                air recyclers, the hum of the power generators, the creaks and groans from the hull sensors as the station
                wearily limped its way around the star. He could see the currents of thoughts inside the computer, the
                unimaginably complex machine that had kept him alive. He saw the logical agony it was in, trying to fulfil the
                charge given to it by his father, and yet not able to compute a way to do so. He wanted to spend more time
                observing it – but he could also feel the myriad warnings from the sensors, warnings of low energy levels and a
                cornucopia of failed components. There wasn’t much time. He moved on, reaching out further, feeling the
                computer’s connections to the control and drive systems of the stations. Without quite knowing it, he had come
                to a decision.

                He started channeling the remaining fuel into the drive power systems, feeling them respond with a burst of
                energy and readings that he could not understand. For the first time in twenty thousand years, the station’s
                drive emitters lit up with a blinding flash of radiant energy. Everything was shaking, nearly out of control.
                Grimly, he hung on, finding the guidance systems and bringing them online. He pointed the station directly at
                the star.

                So the universe thought it could get rid of him so easily, so unfeelingly, just like it had destroyed his father
                and mother and all the others on the station? He would not let that happen. He was in control. Not the computer,
                not the airless void, not time or entropy. They had tried and they had failed. He was tired of being lead. He
                was in charge now. He would go out on his own terms.
