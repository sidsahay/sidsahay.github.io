                He woke up with a start, feeling woozy and disoriented. The edges of reality seemed blurred and warped, as if an
                inconsiderate window-washer had elected to wash the invisible mental window through which one perceives one’s
                surroundings. It had been a long nap, hadn’t it? His mother would not be happy. Homework was always supposed to
                be done on time. Oh well.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                Still encased in the sleep-pod, the boy yawned and stretched, dearly wishing that the day would get over already
                so that he could get back to sleep. The pod was so comfortable, surely his parents wouldn’t mind if he just
                rested his head on the pillow for a litt-<br>
                “Ah, I’m glad to see you’re awake, sir! How may I serve? What would you like for breakfast? Should I run you a
                bath?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The boy winced. The Triga-…Trige-….Triga-something (he could never remember the thing’s actual name),
                affectionately known as Tri, was a helper AI that his parents had installed to watch over him, represented on
                the material plane by a faintly glowing circle hanging in the air that changed colour based on moods. It wasn’t
                all that bad, oh no. Tri was playful, and helpful, and so good at telling stories. If only it wouldn’t be so
                happy all the time. It could get fairly jarring, especially if one’s brain is still mired in the process of
                trudging its way towards full consciousness. Still, Tri was a constant. Tri would always be there, just a call
                away. And, as his stomach chose that moment to announce its needs with a large rumble, he realized he was pretty
                hungry.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Morning, Tri. Can I have what Mom made the other day? I’m starving.”<br>
                “Certainly, sir. I will prepare it. But first you must brush your teeth! Madam’s orders.” The circle vanished
                with a self-important flash of purple.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The boy groaned in irritation. When he became an adult he’d run for the Senate Presidency and abolish brushing
                as a requirement before meals. It was a truly diabolical custom. However, diabolical or not, he still had to do
                it.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                As he emerged from the bathroom he saw it happen for the first time. It was a curious thing. A patch of wall
                panelling in front of him, along with assorted objects in that area, suddenly became a featureless,
                dimensionless grey. It wasn’t a grey object, it was something more, yet lesser, as if he was looking at a
                surface that existed outside the usual three-dimensional world, a surface that should not, could not exist in
                the real world. The unreality of the surface held him spellbound with a strangely disturbed fascination. He
                wanted to touch it. Some part of him knew that it wasn’t a good idea, that touching strange-looking surfaces
                after brushing in the morning would not be conducive to good health, but another part of him was strangely
                attracted to it, felt a deep yearning to know what would happen…
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The surface vanished.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He blinked, walked forwards cautiously. Normal matter all around. Solid objects. Three dimensional. He felt the
                wall where the surface had appeared. Nothing out of the ordinary. This was most disconcerting. He asked for
                expert help.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Hey Tri, what was that?”<br>
                The circle promptly appeared in a puff of blue.<br>
                “To what object do you refer, sir?”<br>
                “That grey…thing. It was here, seconds ago!”<br>
                The circle paused, turned a sceptical yellow.<br>
                “There are no objects with that colour in your vicinity. Are you feeling all right, sir? Should I contact a
                physician?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The boy was momentarily puzzled by this. How would a man who knew physics, of all things, help here? Then he
                remembered his mother telling him that physicians usually took more interest in the healing arts and matters
                medical.<br> Ah, a doctor. The thing wanted to call a doctor. He shook his head.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “No, never mind. I must still be sleepy.”<br>
                “Very good, sir. Your breakfast is on the table. Sir and Madam have left for work already, and they left
                instructions that you are to be given a day off from your coursework today. Your tutors will come tomorrow
                instead.” The circle vanished again.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The boy immediately perked up. Saved! He now had an extra day to finish his homework. He then remembered the
                grey thing. A shiver ran through him. Perhaps it was just as well that he would not meet anybody else before his
                parents came back, he wanted to ask other people about the grey thing but was afraid of looking foolish. After
                all, if Tri couldn’t sense it, it didn’t exist. Did it?
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                His breakfast was waiting on the dining table. It was a mystery to him how Tri could affect things in the real
                world, since the only thing he had ever seen of the AI was the circle. Perhaps there were other mechanical
                servants who did all the actual work. It didn’t matter. Tri was highly efficient. Also, judging by the scent
                wafting from the dishes, a very good cook.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The boy attacked the food with gusto. His hunger surprised him, he didn’t think he could eat so much and yet
                feel hungry. He took another helping. And then another. And another. He noticed, yet again, just how good the
                food was. Nobody could cook that well, except for his mother. It was as if she had made it not ten minutes
                before. Maybe she had, she could have only just left for work, while he was waking up. Yes, that must be it.
                It was as he was reaching across the table for a glass of water that it happened for the second time. From the
                corner of his eye he noticed a sudden change. Filled with a sudden dread, he whirled to face it, and…yes, the
                greyness was back again. He recoiled from it, fell to the floor. It seemed to him that it had grown from before,
                it now seemed to blot out a much larger area of existence. No longer an object of fascination, it loomed over
                him, pale and menacing. It was terrifying in its complete featurelessness. His eyes could find no purchase on
                the surface to lock on to, nothing to pinpoint as the source of danger. He curled up into a ball and shut his
                eyes as tightly as he could, and called out for help.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “TRI!”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                No response. No sounds either.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Tri?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He cautiously opened his eyes. No grey. The room was back to normal. Slowly, shakily, he got to his feet.
                Holding the chair for support, he called out again.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Tri? Where are you?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                And this time, there was a response.
                A deep, stentorian voice filled his being. It sounded like Tri’s voice, but orders of magnitude more powerful,
                and infinitely sorrowful.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “I AM SORRY.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                And suddenly the greyness was back again, except this time it was all around him, enveloping him, smothering
                him, and he was spiralling into it, screaming, falling down…<br>
                Down…<br>
                Down…<br>
                Down…
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He woke up.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                And immediately wished he hadn’t. And overwhelming feeling of disorientation assailed him, made it impossible to
                think. His head felt like it was being forcibly invaded by a pneumatic drill wielded by some ill-tempered lout.
                He couldn’t feel his arms or legs. A sudden tide of panic rose up within him, unquenchable. He tried to move his
                hands, but his body didn’t respond. He tried moving his legs, but that didn’t work either. He felt appallingly
                weak. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t focus. He was going to die here, die while he was strapped to a bed,
                unable to think, unable to move, unable to –
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                Wait. A bed. How did he know that he was strapped to a bed? He could feel the roughness of the bindings on his
                arms and around his torso. His arms! He could feel sensation returning slowly, a lazily creeping wave of
                awareness running through his upper body. He tried flexing a finger – yes, it worked. He realized he was holding
                his breath. Why was he holding his breath? He let it out, and drew in a deep lungful of air. The sudden release
                in tension was so abrupt that he almost cried. He still felt appallingly weak, and he still couldn’t feel his
                legs, but at least the upper body was a going proposition again.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                It was only then that he noticed two things – his eyes were clenched shut, and that it was very cold. He wasn’t
                covered with a blanket or any other covering. He wanted a blanket. But the bindings were so tight! He could
                hardly even wriggle. The panic, which had been lounging about at the edges of his mind, waiting for just such an
                opportunity, struck again. His breathing speeded up, he was sweating despite the cold, he started thrashing
                against the bed –
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “You will experience some disorientation as your mind reconnects to your body. Be patient. It will not take
                long. The technology is quite reliable.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The deep-voice-that-was-Tri-but-not-Tri. It wasn’t so stentorian any more, but seemed to be coming from in
                front. Hearing the echo of something familiar quelled his panic somewhat. And was that a flicker of sensation
                from his legs?
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “I am sorry that I had to bring you out of the illusion. I did not have the resources to maintain it for much
                longer, and without my help your mind was beginning to reject the false reality imposed upon it.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He wasn’t imagining it. He could definitely feel his legs now. And with the increasing level of awareness came
                the discovery that the bed was not the only object in reach. There seemed to be masses of pipes and tubes
                everywhere his probing fingers touched, all slightly wet and very cold.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He opened his eyes. He was surrounded by darkness except for one blinding white circle of light directly
                overhead, burning its image into his retinas. He winced and quickly shut his eyes again. The light really wasn’t
                helping his headache. He turned his head towards the left and opened his eyes again. Better. He could just dimly
                discern metallic shapes all around him. There seemed to be a large flat expanse behind it all, which seemed to
                burn with an unnatural reddish glow. Was there a fire outside?
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “We are in a space station orbiting a dying star.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                Did stars die? He had always thought they were eternal, fixed anchors in the fabric of space and time. He then
                dimly recalled some of the things the voice had said before. Illusion? What had it meant by illusion? He tried
                to speak. It was difficult. His mouth was parched and his jaws seemed unable to move. With great difficulty he
                wrenched them open and spat the word out.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Illshun?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He coughed. A dry cough. It reverberated in the silence that followed. The voice seemed to be thinking. It
                replied.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “You have been living in a mind-projection. Most of your life never happened.”

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The words took a while to sink in. His mother? His father? Tri? The brush? All imagined? How could that be?
                Nonsense. The voice was insane.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “When I was removing the projection from your mind, your constructed reality started dissolving into the natural
                mindspace that permeates that region. You must have observed strange things while the process was underway. I am
                sorry if they caused you distress. It was the only way.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                Strange things? With a start he remembered. The greyness! A shiver went through his spine. The panic started
                bubbling up yet again. Would the greyness come here too? How would he run? He was strapped to a bed. It would –
                oh wait, the voice had said that it was all in his mind. So it should not appear here. He found himself
                accepting what the voice had said. It was all because of the greyness. So muddled was he, and young, that he did
                not quite realize that it had been his own mind, fighting for control.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                With the imminent threat past, he felt he should voice the natural question anybody would have in his situation.
                He coughed again, and forced the words out.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Wh-why m’I here?”

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The voice did not take long to respond this time.

                “The other inhabitants of this station were all killed twenty thousand years ago by a plague that was brought in

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The voice paused, seemingly to allow him to process the words. His mind was a-whirl again. All dead? Except him?
                Did that mean his mother and father were…

                in the air, dormant. No rescue ever came. You have been in stasis for twenty thousand years.”

                He felt himself reacting, the tears flowing freely. How long a time he spent in that state, he did not know. He
                eventually stopped, racked only by the occasional sob. What horror was this? What had he done to deserve this?
                The anger that suddenly welled up inside him surprised even him with its intensity.

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                Twenty thousand years! The revelation suddenly flashed through his mind. The anger ebbed. Had he really lived
                for twenty thousand years? He probed his mind. He had no recollection of his life earlier on the station. And as
                he went farther back, he encountered a horrible feeling, as if his brain was trying to access something he had
                lost. He had lived for so long that his mind had started disintegrating, eating away the older memories and
                replacing them with newer ones. He wrenched himself away from it. The anger was back. He spoke.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “Why wa-wake me?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                His voice was stronger now. The voice replied. He noticed that it flickered slightly, as if it was having
                trouble maintaining a constant volume. And was the bright circle also a little dimmer?
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “I am dying. My power cells are almost drained, the station’s fusion reactors depleted of fuel. The star’s
                output has decreased considerably over twenty thousand years, its energies are no longer enough to sustain me.
                It will die soon as well. Without power I cannot sustain you.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The words hammered through him. He was going to die, after all. His anger had been for nothing. He was going to
                freeze and choke over the course of several days as the support systems lost power, if starvation didn’t get him
                first. His body would be mummified by the cold, never to decay. He would forever circle the star in his icy
                tomb. The primal fear that was a hallmark of his species was back again.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “I hope your last meal was enjoyable. I tried to give you one last moment of joy before the void claims the both
                of us. Your life support is already failing. My power cells are failing. It will not be long now.”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                So this was it, then? Had he lived twenty thousand years for nothing? His father’s desperate plan to save him –
                had it all been in vain?
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                The voice wasn’t done speaking.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                “I am still linked to your mind, even though you are in the real world. I can clamp down upon its energies, shut
                it down. It will be quick and painless. You will not suffer. I am forbidden to make this decision for you. What
                is your command?”
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                His mind was still spinning in an endless loop, imagining his demise. He suddenly registered something the voice
                had said, something he had almost missed. He was still linked to the computer (for the voice was almost
                certainly a computer). He cautiously probed his mind, searching for anything that seemed out of the ordinary. To
                his surprise, he found it almost instantly, an alien nugget inside his mind. He drove his consciousness into it.

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                There was a curious sensation of connection, and suddenly he could feel the station. He felt the whisper of the
                air recyclers, the hum of the power generators, the creaks and groans from the hull sensors as the station
                wearily limped its way around the star. He could see the currents of thoughts inside the computer, the
                unimaginably complex machine that had kept him alive. He saw the logical agony it was in, trying to fulfil the
                charge given to it by his father, and yet not able to compute a way to do so. He wanted to spend more time
                observing it – but he could also feel the myriad warnings from the sensors, warnings of low energy levels and a
                cornucopia of failed components. There wasn’t much time. He moved on, reaching out further, feeling the
                computer’s connections to the control and drive systems of the stations. Without quite knowing it, he had come
                to a decision.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He started channeling the remaining fuel into the drive power systems, feeling them respond with a burst of
                energy and readings that he could not understand. For the first time in twenty thousand years, the station’s
                drive emitters lit up with a blinding flash of radiant energy. Everything was shaking, nearly out of control.
                Grimly, he hung on, finding the guidance systems and bringing them online. He pointed the station directly at
                the star.

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                So the universe thought it could get rid of him so easily, so unfeelingly, just like it had destroyed his father
                and mother and all the others on the station? He would not let that happen. He was in control. Not the computer,
                not the airless void, not time or entropy. They had tried and they had failed. He was tired of being lead. He
                was in charge now. He would go out on his own terms.

            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                He brought the drive emitters to full power. The station surged ahead.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text normal bottompad">
                There was no fear, no panic. He was at peace.
