        Knuril walked through the largely empty halls of Deep Space Station H7. At this time of station's night, most of the population was asleep, tired and exhausted from the ardous task of mining the local asteroid field for precious metals. He thought of a time when gold was considered precious and snorted derisively. In this day and age, "precious" meant whatever the Nutzco Metallurgy Corp. was willing to pay the most for. Gold was somewhere around iron, treated like so much scrap. Being a pragmatic individual, Knuril followed market trends very closely, thus his current occupation as an expert in the mining of francium, that fantastically rare and short-lived metal that is sometimes generated in asteroid fields through rare cosmic events. H7 was built near one of said events.

        That story is a pretty good one, thought Knuril to himself, looking at the angry red star whose instabilties created the conveniently-located francium. For of course H7 was far more than a simple mining rig, just as Knuril himself was much more than a francium miner. His boss back at HQ, old man Graves...that is to say, Admiral Gilash Than-Zurion, was inordinately fond of old westerns and stoutly maintained that his agents should get enough exercise otherwise they lose their edge and start craving desk jobs, thus making them useful only for administrative work (like him). The exercises in question tended to be dangerous on average and fatal on occasion, but Knuril didn't mind. He had nowhere to go anyway and the pay was good.
